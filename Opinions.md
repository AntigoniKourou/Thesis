What is an opinion? (Liu Handbobook 2010)

--- Types of opinions
1) Regular - Direct/Indirect
2) Comparative (out of my scope)
Jindal and Liu 2006, Liu 2006

--- Structure of opinions
An opinion is a quintuple
(**ej, ajk, soijkl, hi, tl**), where
* **ej** is a target entity.
* **ajk** is an aspect/feature of the entity ej.
* **soijkl** is the sentiment value of the opinion from the opinion holder hi
on aspect ajk of entity ej at time tl. 
* **soijkl** is +ve, -ve, or neu, or a more
granular rating.
* **hi** is an opinion holder.
* **tl** is the time when the opinion is expressed.
The five components are essential and must correspond to each other. Without any of them it would be very difficult to deal with the opinions.

In knowledge management and Semantic Web research areas, ontologies are considered essential in order to describe various concepts and relationships between them. Ontologies are formal specifications of a shared conceptualization of a domain. For the accommodation domain and related domains a few ontologies have been proposed, which cover different aspects in this domain. However these ontologies are often found as sub-ontologies of the e-tourism domain. In the table below a few ontologies relevant to the accommodation-related web services and the tourism concepts are compared by [Source] (https://scholar.google.nl/scholar.bib?q=info:FsYEB1nXuhgJ:scholar.google.com/&output=citation&scisig=AAGBfm0AAAAAVxSmDIikbQj50-ZNJrqR4eVdeMcdCp_R&scisf=4&hl=en). The table below gives an overview.

In my research, the ontology of accommodation is based on several sources. [Hontology] (https://scholar.google.nl/scholar.bib?q=info:uA6ZF-SnW5sJ:scholar.google.com/&output=citation&scisig=AAGBfm0AAAAAVxSnCflVfX11_ZHUH1IzPBLR08f--o5j&scisf=4&hl=en), which is brought in alignment with Accommodation in QALL-ME, Tourist Accommodationsin DBpedia.org and Lodging Business  in Schema.org, was initially created by following different scenarios of booking an accommodation and processing reviews in Web services. [ACCO Accommodation Ontology] (https://scholar.google.nl/scholar.bib?q=info:r_fEDf7xMU8J:scholar.google.com/&output=citation&scisig=AAGBfm0AAAAAVxSog_vpJbXFRR18zZeIj6ZEK4ZjgZzO&scisf=4&hl=en), which is an extension of GoodRelations ontology, is based on Owl Ontology Language (OWL), is supported by Google and Yahoo and focuses on e-commerce accommodation offers.
Besides these two ontologies above, my ontology covers the Web based accommodation services such as: AirBnb.com, Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com.

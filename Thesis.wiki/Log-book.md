**Monday, April 25th**
* Set up the connection Python to Neo4J (py2neo). The connection is all good but I lack access to the server through the REST API (Adam will check it out since the server is located in his PC - waiting) (3.5 hrs)
* Wrote the [script] (https://github.com/AntigoniKourou/Thesis/blob/master/lemmas.py) which would give a list of lemmas for every feature of the ontology (6-7 hrs) 

**Saturday, April 23rd**
* Set up all the pre-processing environment (NLTK packages, played around with them) (2.5 hrs)
* Tried the connection Python to Neo4J in order to get the data but unsuccessful (6-7 hrs)

**Friday, April 22nd**

**Thursday, April 21st**
* Meeting @HAL24K. Discussed all the changes (1.5 hrs)

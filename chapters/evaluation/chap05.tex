\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chap:dis}
\initial{T}his section will explain that in order to check the efficiency of the chosen algorithm, it is tested by humans. A sample of text reviews which are mined using the algorithm are then given to humans to find out the percentage of the precision of the algorithm.The setting will consist of an online survey, in which for a given text each person will have to identify the sentiment for a list of aspects. If the aspect is not mentioned in the text, then it will have no rating. The rating willl be from 1-5. The text of these reviews will be in Appendix as well as the answers of each person, who filled the survey. (Describe it)

For evaluation, all reviews has been read and evaluated by human beings. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is measured by using Precision (p), Recall(r) and accuracy. 
p =TP/(TP + FP); r =TP/(TP + FN)
where TP (true positives) is the number of reviews that the system correctly extract the right features and opinion; FP (false positives) is the number of reviews that the system falsely extract wrong features or wrong opinion; FN (false negatives) is the number of reviews that the system fails to identify. \cite{yaakub2012integration}

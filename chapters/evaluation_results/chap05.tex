\initial{T}his section will explain that in order to check the efficiency of the chosen algorithm, it is tested by humans. A sample of text reviews which are mined using the algorithm are then given to humans to find out the percentage of the precision of the algorithm. 

For evaluation, all reviews has been read and evaluated by human beings. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is measured by using Precision (p), Recall(r) and accuracy. 
p =TP/(TP + FP); r =TP/(TP + FN)
where TP (true positives) is the number of reviews that the system correctly extract the right features and opinion; FP (false positives) is the number of reviews that the system falsely extract wrong features or wrong opinion; FN (false negatives) is the number of reviews that the system fails to identify. \cite{yaakub2012integration}

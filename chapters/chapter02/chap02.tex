\initial{T}his chapter is a literature review of the research done until now on the field of sentiment mining for analysing customer feedback.

\section{Using sentiment mining for customer feedback}
In this section will cover the cases where sentiment mining techniques are used for text analysing of customer feedback. These cases are focused mostly in movies and products. 

\section{Efficiency of sentiment mining algorithms}
This section will cover the research made on testing the efficiency of sentiment mining algorithms, since it is still an issue the way they work and how dumb they are. This will serve as a basis for going on to the methodology, where I will also test my chosen algorithm.

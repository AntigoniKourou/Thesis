The ouput data of the pipeline is also part of the Github repository. However, to access the Airbnb data, please contact me by email to \href{mailto:antigoni.kourou@student.uva.nl}{antigoni.kourou@student.uva.nl} or the data owners, HAL24K by contacting them directly on the website \href{http://hal24k.com/} {www.hal24k.com}. The complete analysis and results of the work in Jupyter Notebook are included in this Appendix. In some cases where the codes are long, the converter from \textbf{.ipynb} to \textbf{.pdf} has cut the pieces. However, the actual files can be read and/or downloaded in the \textbf{.ipynb} version by following the links below.

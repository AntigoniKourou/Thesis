\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

\initial{S}haring economy, \textit{the peer-to-peer-based activity of obtaining, giving, or sharing the access  to  goods  and  services,  coordinated  through community-based online services} \cite{hamari2015sharing}, is a very important phenomenon grown exponentially over the last decade. Building trust in these online marketplaces is the key to the adoption of sharing economy. Even though all the markets require some minimum amount of trust, for Internet markets this is a particular challenge considering the fact that trades are typically anonymous, geographically dispread and executed sequentially \cite{owen2014trust}. To incentivize trustworthiness, online markets employ feedback mechanisms, which allow traders to share opinions about past experiences. Online feedback mechanisms, also known as reputation systems, \textit{have emerged as a viable mechanism for fostering cooperation among strangers in such settings} \cite{dellarocas2003digitization}. Examples of these systems, for instance eBay, Amazon or AirBnb, after each trade, encourage both parties to give feedback about their trading partner based on their experience. 

For online marketplaces to succeed and prevent a market of lemons, their feedback technologies must be able to not only collect users feedback, but to properly analyze it and differentiate among sellers. The most common types of feedback are ratings and text comments.  An important separation exists between the distinct role of text comments as tacit knowledge and ratings as explicit knowledge. According to \cite{pavlou2006nature}, text comments are particularly interesting for the audience as a new trust-building means in online marketplaces, which reveals hidden knowledge that cannot be described by negative/positive ratings, therefore they have an important and irreplacible role in online feedback systems. Furthermore, \cite{fradkin2016bias} suggest that text
opinions influence the users’ decisions even when the rating for the listing is high. A survey by \cite{pavlou2006institutional} asked the respondents to indicate how many feedback comments they examined for the seller they purchased from.before each transaction they did online. The result showed that 81\% reported examining 25 comments (one webpage), 5\% viewed 50 comments, 11\% more than 50 ones, and only 3\% did not examine any text comments. This finding reveals that despite the importance of text feedback to the users, it is apparently difficult for the them to access the meaning of numerous text comments for a single item \cite{pavlou2006institutional}.  Given this situation, the average human reader will have difficulties on identifying and extracting the relevant information from the opinions in them.  

Automated analysis systems are thus needed \cite{liu2012sentiment}. Natural language processing (NLP) enables computers to derive meaning from any human written input, including their opinions. The NLP methods for doing so fall into the category of sentiment mining methods, known also as \textit{opinion mining}. Examples of their application include mainly the movie rating systems (Netflix, IMDb) and the product rating systems (eBay). This research proposes the implementation of opinion mining methods as complementary part of online feedback systems and info


Let us consider an example of a person who is searching for accommodation in the Airbnb site. The user really wants the room to be quiet, no more than 5 min walking from the public transport station and to have good Wifi connection. In order to find information about all these features the user has to check several options and to read the comments of each of them, in order to identify the required features.



\section{Customer Focus Theory}
\label{sec:CFTH}

When offering a service or product, it is essential to understand what consumers' preferences are and how can we shape the offerings accordingly to create value. Customer Focus Theory is one of Information Studies theories, which specifically offers a guide on how to put the focus on the customer. This theory should be explained according to the context of my research (where it is placed and adds value on the framework) as shown in Figure \ref{fig:CustomerFocus}.

\section{Online Feedback systems}

Various mechanisms have been designed and utilized
in C2C auction markets to promote trust and reduce risk.
For instance,
eBay's “Feedback Forum” is a form of community enforcement.
In eBay, after each trade, both buyers and
sellers are encouraged to leave comments about their
trading partners based on their experience. Comments
about traders are kept under each trader's profile, and can be accessed by everyone who visits eBay. This way, the
system tries to deter dishonest behavior by conveying
facts and opinions about past trades. Kollock [15]
conceptually summarizes online reputation systems and
concludes that their effectiveness to manage the risks of
unsecured trades seems to be impressive. Resnick et al.
[20] review the online reputation systems and argue that
the reputation systems appear to perform reasonably well
despite their theoretical and practical difficulties. \cite{yang2007effects}


\subsection{Characteristics of most popular OFSs}
\label{subsec:popularOFS}

This subsection will explain how online feedback systems work. In addition, it will describe, categorize and point out the differences between the typical types of OFS used by the most successful online marketers (Ebay, Amazon, Yelp, TripAdvisor and Airbnb). 

\subsection{Methods for analyzing customer feedback}
\label{subsec:feedbackmethods}
\subsection{Three ways to move toward a more efficient OFS}
\textit{Preliminary:} In 2008 the giant of online marketplaces eBay changed radically the way how their feedback system was working. Many researchers have analyzed the eBay changes \cite{fradkin2016bias,resnick2006value,bolton2013engineering,dini2009buying,dellarocas2008sound}, and findings suggest three ways to move toward a more efficient feedback system. A solution would be to mitigate to a new validated feedback system and follow it strictly. However abandoning the existing system and move to a new one requires a lot of effort and sometimes the model also does not fit considering the differences in the type of transactions. The second solution suggested is to build channels of feedback in a targeted way, for example only one side feedback or the element of anonymousness. The third solution learnt from the eBay case suggests using complementary methods for feedback analysis. This third solution offers in itself a lot of potential considering the big variety of tools for data analysis. This paper proposes text mining of reviews as a complementary method for feedback analysis in the reputation systems.

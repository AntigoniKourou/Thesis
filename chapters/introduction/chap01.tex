\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

\initial{T}he exponential growth of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has played a great role in the development of tourism industry. Electronic tourism (e-tourism) is the application of ICTs for tourism purposes, including the digitalization of all its processes and value chains \cite{buhalis2003etourism}. Increasingly, ICTs provide users with access to many sources of information and has eventually affected the consumer behavior in tourism industry \cite{mills2004handbook}. Nowadays there is a huge variety of web services which provide a great complexity and diversity of recommended offers for meeting the demands of travelers. However, the personalized consumption patterns and individualistic lifestyles make it incredibly difficult for the service providers to anticipate tourists' behavior \cite{niemann2008enhancing}. Among other factors that influence the consumer behavior, trust in e-tourism is a particular challenge considering the fact that trades are geographically dispread, executed sequentially and  typically anonymous \cite{owen2014trust}. To incentivize trustworthiness, online markets employ feedback mechanisms, which allow consumers to share opinions about past experiences. Online feedback mechanisms, also known as reputation systems, \textit{have emerged as a viable mechanism for fostering cooperation among strangers in such settings} \cite{dellarocas2003digitization}. Examples of these systems, for instance TripAdvisor, Booking.com or AirBnb, after each trade encourage both parties to give feedback about their trading partner based on their own experience. 

Travelers, making use of the ICT tools that facilitate the information retrieval and decision making processes, have now direct access to all types of information provided by tourism agencies, companies, marketers, enterprises or other users. Thus, the new knowledgeable and sophisticated e-tourists  search for relevant and trustworthy information themselves instead of relying on other parties \cite{morrisonn2001predicting}. Furthermore, ICTs and Internet have transformed e-tourism markets from customer-centric to customer-driven \cite{buhalis2011tourism}, meaning that users play a major role in creating and sharing traveling information through blogs and review websites. Buhalis \cite{buhalis2011tourism} suggests that the tourism industry is now required to treat the consumers as "co-producers" of product information, considering that consumer generated content is more likely to be trusted compared to suppliers \cite{nielsen2009}. 

For online marketplaces to succeed and offer accurate information, their feedback technologies must be able to not only collect users feedback, but to properly analyze it and differentiate among sellers. The most common types of consumer generated feedback are ratings and text comments.  An important separation exists between the distinct role of text comments as tacit knowledge and ratings as explicit knowledge. According to \cite{pavlou2006nature}, text comments are particularly interesting for the audience as a new trust-building means in online marketplaces by revealing hidden knowledge that cannot be described by negative/positive ratings, which has an important and irreplaceable role in online feedback systems. In addition, consumers needs are considered multi-dimensional and difficult to measure on discrete scales \cite{luo2005information}, therefore a traveler has to extract the needed information from several sources and types of information provided by agencies, companies or other users. This means that a big part of the work in the decision making process is totally up to the consumer. A survey by \cite{pavlou2006institutional} asked the respondents to indicate how many feedback comments they examined before each online transaction. The result showed that 81\% reported examining 25 comments (one webpage), 5\% viewed 50 comments, 11\% more than 50 ones, and only 3\% did not examine any text comments. This finding reveals that despite the importance of text feedback to the users, it is apparently difficult for them to access the meaning of numerous text comments \cite{pavlou2006institutional}.  Given this situation, the average human reader will have difficulties on identifying and extracting the relevant information from the opinions in them.  

Current online travel systems, aiming to assist the consumer in finding suitable offers, allow the user to rank and filter the information based on location-price factor or on the overall ratings accumulated from the feedback system. However, this does not necessarily mean that the top result is the most suitable for a certain user considering the personal requirements. For example, for somebody who has trouble sleeping and therefore  a \textit{quiet} place is a nonnegotiable requirement, a room in the city center, with a very good price and rating may not be suitable. The customer in this case would have to check all the text comments of each listing in the search results in order to find the proper match. This task is not only time consuming but also inefficient given that most of the users will not read all the comments of the listing. The service providers often offer summaries to all feedback comments, which mostly consist on a bunch of most used words. However, this bag of words does not provide the users with extra information about a feature except of the fact that it is mentioned somewhere in the comments, thus the user still has to read for each listing in the search result all the text comments mentioning this feature, meaning that it still does not reduce much of the travelers' work. 

Automated analysis systems are thus needed \cite{liu2012sentiment}. Natural language processing (NLP) enables computers to derive meaning from any human written input, including their opinions. The NLP methods for doing so fall into the category of sentiment mining methods, known also as \textit{opinion mining}. 
This paper proposes a pipeline, which uses an ontology based approach combined with sentiment mining techniques for generating opinion scores for each accommodation feature mentioned in the reviews of a feedback system. The sentiment score would serve in this case as the discrete estimator of the customer requirements, which are represented by accommodation features. 
The final idea of the pipeline is to offer to the user the possibility of ranking the accommodation search results based on their "difficult to measure" individualistic requirement, besides the price-location ranking factors. 
Through the use of the pipeline, this research aims to give an answer to the following two questions. Firstly, \textit{how good can feature-based opinion mining estimate the quality of customer requirements represented by accommodation features in e-tourism feedback systems?} Secondly, \textit{how will the implementation of this pipeline affect the customer satisfaction during the decision making process?} 

\section{Customer Focus Theory}
\label{sec:CFTH}

When offering a service or product, it is essential to understand what consumers' preferences are and how can we shape the offerings accordingly to create value. Customer Focus Theory is one of Information Studies theories, which specifically offers a guide on how to put the focus on the customer. This theory should be explained according to the context of my research (where it is placed and adds value on the framework) as shown in Figure \ref{fig:CustomerFocus}.

\section{Online Feedback systems}

Various mechanisms have been designed and utilized
in C2C auction markets to promote trust and reduce risk.
For instance,
eBay's “Feedback Forum” is a form of community enforcement.
In eBay, after each trade, both buyers and
sellers are encouraged to leave comments about their
trading partners based on their experience. Comments
about traders are kept under each trader's profile, and can be accessed by everyone who visits eBay. This way, the
system tries to deter dishonest behavior by conveying
facts and opinions about past trades. Kollock [15]
conceptually summarizes online reputation systems and
concludes that their effectiveness to manage the risks of
unsecured trades seems to be impressive. Resnick et al.
[20] review the online reputation systems and argue that
the reputation systems appear to perform reasonably well
despite their theoretical and practical difficulties. \cite{yang2007effects}

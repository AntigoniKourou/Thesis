Here will go the discussion.
\begin{itemize}
\item  How my work is similar to others and where it differs
\item Recap of the results and their weakness
\item Recap of evaluation
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Language only english
\item  Could have used more algorithms and compare them
\item More people for evaluation
\item Accommodation ontology and query search n-gram
\item 
\end{itemize}




\section{Implications}

The main contribution of this work is threefold. First, an ontology-
based feature identification permits the reuse of existing
vocabularies and ontologies in order to extract feature related
information from opinions in different domains. Second, four different
configurable methods for feature polarity identification are
proposed. These methods can be configured with different parameters
to obtain the best polarity identification approach for different
domains and languages. Finally, the vector analysis based
opinion mining approach permits the sentiment classification of
a document to be calculated, and no training phases are necessary.
\section{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
\item  The beginning of a recommendation system
\item Extend the algorithm to n-grams
\item 
\end{itemize}
